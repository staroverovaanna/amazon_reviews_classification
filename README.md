# amazon_reviews_classification

This is a pet-project, where I use some nlp-methods on data from Amazon Reviews 

[here ypu can download the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/arhamrumi/amazon-product-reviews]

First, I apply a simple Logistic Regression for binary classification;

After that, I train a Logistic Regression as a multi-class method;

At the end, there is a Random Forest model given.

I will use precision score as a metrics to measure model-quality. My final score is 0.92.


Exploratory analysis: I will process data, look for descriptive statistics, histograms and some examples.
Text transformation: I use nltk to get tokens and get rid of noise.
